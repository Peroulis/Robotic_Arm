Manipulate a 3R robotic arm in Matlab. Forward and inverse kinematics

For the Forward Kinematics run RoboticArm 
  Zero position angles(0,0,0) 
  User input: Angle in RADIANS when asked 
  CTRL + C for termination


For the Inverse Kinematics enter inverse_kinematics folder

Run RoboticArm.m
Input the final tip position. The final transformation is previewed
